# Modelling longitudinal data

#### This repository contains my research attachment presentations on modelling of longitudinal data, datasets and STATA DO files.

##### Research attachment 1: The Dynamic Relationship Between Diet, Physical Activity, Alcohol Drinking and Smoking in English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).

A binary logistic regression, random effects model was used to determine which of the health behaviours - fruit and vegetable intake, alcohol drinking and physical activity - are significant predictors of smoking among adults aged 50 years and older in ELSA. Dataset, Stata DO file and powerpoint presentation attached.

##### Research attachment 2: Exploring Gender Differences in the Relationship Between Obesity and Employment Outcomes
